Jekyll works fine but i decided to start from scratch. A basic site in Jekyll but without a theme. I'll make my own and learn along the way.
I'm sure the system with gems Jekyll has is fine, but as is now it hides stuff from me. I'd rather start from scratch.
Turns out it's enough to run:
> jekyll serve

to get it working. That's all.
> jekyll serve --watch

is all that is needed to get auto-updates. Seems very simple and functional.
