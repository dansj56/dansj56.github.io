After the depressing experience with Docker I decided to buy a new computer. Turns out my old one doesn't support Hypervisor instructions. As I am bit old-fashioned and don't like solving problems with raw power i looked for the cheaper alternative. 
>And I bought a PC... (that's not a Mac)
My wife didn't like that! Nor did I. 
the strangest experience was that PC-building hasn't changed since 2001 which was the last time I put together a PC.
Still ATX-format and still a lot of effing screws and cables. I was amazed by how little that has changed. I really thought PC building would be a more modern (Mac-like...) experience. The PC-world is, design-wise, stuck in the late 1990s.
