I finally got working with Sass and creating my own theme. Took a while but it works fine. now. Can't say that Sass is a wonder, there is still allot of "CSS" o write. But I can see the advantage with it for larger and more complex sites. It would do wonders then. The ability to nest and just add tags, selectors, into others is fantastic compared to pure CSS.
The variables makes it really easy to change colors too. 
But with the introduction of variables... I just feel that I would like to write a wrapper program with some sort of GUI to select elements and stuff....

Tomorrow I'm going to look into the functions in Sass.
