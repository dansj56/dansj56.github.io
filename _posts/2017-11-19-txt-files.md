##robots.txt##
My site currently disallows nothing.
I believe the Internet should be as open as possible, so why shouldn't I allow all robots access? As the site is structured now there are no folders with useless content. In the future i guess there will be folders without "real" content. It would be nice to the robots to specify that in the file. I read about the file and it's format at: [The Web Robots Pages](http://www.robotstxt.org)

##humans.txt##
A file, not cluttering up the website itself, that tells us who made a site. Frequently used to say thank you also.
I read about [Humans.txt](http://humanstxt.org) at that site. For this project it seems somewhat unnecessary.
