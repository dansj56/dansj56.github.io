## OpenGraph
![The OpenGraph logo](pic/og.png)For the social web, a way for me to define how my content is shared. This post for example contains an image and that image is defined as the post-image for this post... I guess it's really useful for a heavily social oriented site. It makes the content a lot more accessible for people. 
The [Facebook: Best Practices](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/best-practices/#images) defines some rules to try and adhere to.
I have only used the basic og-tags for type, title and so on.
Jekyll generates the tags based on what kind of information each post or page contains.

## Comments
The default theme for Jekyll contains code for using Disqus for the comments. As of writing this I don't yet know if it works. More on that later...
