A meaningful day. I tried to install Docker but it said:

Oh, man. Turns out my old trusted [iMac][iMac-2008] from 2008 doesn't have Hypervisor support in the CPU. I really like my old workhorse and it does everything plenty fast. I don't like throwing computers away that work fine. ( I still have my MacBook from 2004...) When they don't work anymore - then I don't have a problem getting an update. 

I remember writing my final paper from _gymnasiet_ on an old [i386][386] SX 25Mhz (that's _SX_ = 16 bit only) and it worked just fine. 

Well after a series of problems getting [RubyGems][ruby-gems] installed properly Jekyll is now up and running locally without Docker. This is my first experiment with it. 

What problems am i going to run into...
