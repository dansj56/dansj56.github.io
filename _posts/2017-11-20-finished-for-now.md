## Comments
Well, it was easy to get Disqus working but i haven't figured out how to style the Disqus content yet. I'll deal with that tomorrow. The net thing in using Jekyll is to stop with my own themes and start using the Gems and themes Jekyll includes. But it was certainly much more interesting staring from scratch (apart from the Disqus-stuff.)

I like that GitHub builds my site and that was a really efficient way to create some documentation for a project. I read that U can also have a gh-pages branch on a repository with the connected site.

I tested OG with Facebook and it works. The Facebook Debugger though complains about missing two tags: *og:description, *fb:app_id
I don't have time right now to fix the fb-one, I don't understand that one.
It also would like me to specify the dimension of every image linked as an og:image. But that seems way out of scope of Jekyll and a small static site. I guess I could decide on a static image size to use everywhere but that surely defeats the purpose of flexibility and quick updates.

I'd say, given what I've done so far that Jekyll works fine far small static stuff but it quickly gets cumbersome the more social features one would like. 
I really like the Sass though, it does save a lot of time once you get to know it. The nesting and variables are extremely practical. But on the other hand I would probably just choose a ready made theme the next time....
